## Synopsis

Basic skeleton for my data science projects

## Motivation

I needed a way to organise all my data science projects in a consistent way

## Description

Will be sent to git only the files needed to produce the report and not the reports files themselves.
All data will be stored separatly to allow secure and encrypted storage.

## Aknowledgement

This setup was greatly inspired by Joris Muller's https://github.com/jomuller/empty_project and his workflow description.
