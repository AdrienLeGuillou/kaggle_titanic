# Titanic machine learning from a disaster

This is my take a the kaggle competion on the Titanic data

## To Do

* Separate the imputation from the models
* Test and tune several models
* Maybe put all the data munging in a simple R file and do the writting after
* clean the libraries and add a description (visualisation, data manipulation)
for each
