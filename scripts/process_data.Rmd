## Process the data

```{r process_data}
process_data <- function(update = FALSE){
  #' Process the raw data and store it in "data/processed/datas.Rda"
  #'
  #' @description function to be completed for each project.
  #' It's purpose is to process the raw data with R and store it into a generic datas.Rda file.
  #' Only the heavy lifting is done here. The objective is to gain time when you run the analysis.
  #'
  #' The function is launch in the setup chunk. It evaluate weather the data have been processed
  #' and stored already to gain time.
  #'
  #' You can force the function to regenerate the datas.Rda from the raw data by setting
  #' the update parameter to TRUE
  #'
  #' @param update if true will recreate the process from raw even if the datas.Rda is present

  if (update == TRUE | file.exists("data/processed/datas.Rda") == FALSE) {
    # Put the data processing here

  }

  data <- TRUE
  save(data, file = "data/processed/datas.Rda")

  # clean workspace before exiting
  rm(list = ls())
}
```
